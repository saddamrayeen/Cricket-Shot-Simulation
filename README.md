# Cricket Trajectory Visualization

This project demonstrates a **Cricket Ball Trajectory** simulation in Unity, where the ball's path is visualized using a **LineRenderer** component. The trajectory line is gradually revealed after the ball collides with the stump. The project also includes sound effects and camera work using **Cinemachine** for smooth movement and dynamic interactions.

## Features
- **Trajectory Visualization**: Real-time visualization of the ball's trajectory using a **LineRenderer**.
- **Gradual Line Reveal**: The trajectory line is drawn gradually after the ball hits the stump, creating a dynamic effect.
- **Smooth Camera Movement**: The camera smoothly follows the ball during its movement, with additional rotations around the trajectory after impact.
- **Sound Effects**: Includes sound for ball jumps, stump hits, and crowd reactions, with independent timing to avoid being affected by the time scale.


## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites:
- Unity (preferably the latest stable version).
- Cinemachine Package (for camera control).

### Steps to Setup:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Cricket-Trajectory-Visualization.git
